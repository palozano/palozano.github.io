# Summary 

This is the source code to Pablo Lozano's website: https://palozano.com. 

I like building things with different tools and I also like minimalism aesthetics, so I decided to do a website with just plain HTML and CSS, no JS/TS magic.

It is a fork from Jon Barron's website: https://jonbarron.info The main differences are that this website uses CSS's flexbox and Jon's is all tables. 

You are welcome to clone this code for your own personal use, just please attribute the source to the original website (Jon Barron's) or to this repo.
